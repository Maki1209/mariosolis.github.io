This is the first entry of Machine Learning (ML) path ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–. The goal is compared between the scratch solution (wihout some prepared package) and well-known Pyhton's packages like Scipy, Sci-kit learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch.

I will share a quick review of Regression problem focus in the basic case: Linear Regression.



Regression problem

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
------

```python
import pandas as pd

```
$$
V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3  
$$ [#eq.1]


In Eq. @eq:1.1 you can see...while in Eq. \eqref{eq:test2}...

$$ 
y = mx + b
$$
