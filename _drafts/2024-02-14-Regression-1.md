This is the first entry of Machine Learning (ML) path ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–. The goal of the following post is compared between the scratch solution (wihout some prepared package) and well-known Pyhton's packages like Scipy, Sci-kit learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch.

In this firs post, I will share a quick review of Regression problem focus in the basic case: Linear Regression.

**Regression problem**
======

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
------

```python
import pandas as pd

```
Entonces

\begin{equation} \label{eq:test}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

In Eq. $\eqref{eq:test}$

$$ 
y = mx + b\,,
$$
