This is the first entry of Machine Learning (ML) path ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–. The goal of the following post is compared between the scratch solution (wihout some prepared package) and well-known Pyhton's packages like Scipy, Sci-kit learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch.

In this firs post, I will share a quick review of Regression problem focus in the basic case: Linear Regression.

**Regression problem**
======

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
------

```python
import pandas as pd

```
Entonces

$$
V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \,, 
$$ [#eq.1]

In Eq. [@eq.1] \eqref{eq.1}

$$ 
y = mx + b\,,
$$
