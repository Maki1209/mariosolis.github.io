🔎 My research are focused in two big areas of the theoretical physics: High-Energy Physics (HEP) and Condensed Matter Physics (CondMat). The aim of my research are brought the techniques of HEP to CondMat. 

Recently, I am interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning 🤖🧠 

In my spare time, I practice ping-pong 🏓 and I follow the F1 🏎 and futbol ⚽!
