I am a theorethical physicist, now I am a PhD student 👨🏻‍🎓 at [Particle&Fields group](https://fisica.cab.cnea.gov.ar/particulas/) at [Instituto Balseiro](https://www.ib.edu.ar/),  in Bariloche: the Argentinian Patagonia.

🔎 My research are focused in two big areas of the theoretical physics: High-Energy Physics (HEP) and Condensed Matter Physics (CondMat). The aim of my research are brought the techniques of HEP to CondMat, and sometimes, in the opposite direction. 

I developed some Data Science projects, you can read about them in my [Portofolio](https://mariosolisb.github.io/homepage/portfolio/).

Recently, I am interested in Machine Learning 🤖🧠. I shared my progress on ML in my [Blog](https://mariosolisb.github.io/homepage/year-archive/). 

In my spare time, I follow the F1 🏁🏎 and futbol ⚽!
