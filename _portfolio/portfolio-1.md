title: "Describing the profile of a bank's coustomer: Cleaning & EDA"
excerpt: "In this project, as a first step, I did cleaned the non-sensical values. The dataset contains some non-sense numerical values and outliers. Also, it contained some typos in categorical variables. 
The second step, I started with the Exploratory Data Analyst of the cleanned dataset. There are some interesting features behind in the dataset. These were found with the statistical analysis (univariate).


Some Python's packages used here: **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

**The code and datasets are available in my Github [repository](https://github.com/MarioSolisB/Profile_of_a_bank_coustomer)ðŸ¤“**

In this project, I used the public dataset that it is available in the [*youtube channel*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGnD1Ki7j-g) (see in the description box of this video). 


**ðŸ”Ž The goal of this project is described or recognized the coustomer's profile after a marketing campaign.** However, I had to clean the dataset in order to implement the Exploratory Data Analysis. Let me explain here, a few steps that I followed in this project.

**For cleanning process** 

1. I found some 'Nan' values inside the columns of the dataset.
2. Due these 'Nan' values are less the 1% of the all entries in dataset, I decided to eliminate these columns.
3. I explored the numerical values and I found some non-sense or outlier vaklues. So I removed them.
4. Then, I worked the categorical entries. There were duplicates with some differences on fontsize. I used some dictionary in order to unify all those values.
5. Save the cleanned dataset.

**For Exploratory Data Analysis**
